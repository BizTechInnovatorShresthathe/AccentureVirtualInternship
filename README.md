# AccentureVirtualInternship
During the virtual  Accenture internship program, I worked with Social Buzz, a rapidly growing digital platform that focuses on anonymous user reactions to various types of content. The company required assistance in scaling their operations effectively and analyzing their massive amounts of unstructured data. The project engagement with Social Buzz lasted for three months, and the following objectives were addressed:

Recommendations for a successful IPO: Provided recommendations and strategies to support Social Buzz in preparing for a successful Initial Public Offering (IPO), considering their growth and market potential.

Analysis of content categories: Analyzed the content categories on Social Buzz to identify the top five categories with the highest aggregate popularity among users.

To accomplish these objectives, three datasets were provided: Content, Reactions, and ReactionTypes. The Content dataset contained information about the uploaded content, while the Reactions dataset contained user reactions to specific pieces of content. The ReactionTypes dataset provided details about the types of reactions and their popularity scores.

Before conducting the analysis, data preparation was performed using Excel. This involved cleaning the datasets by removing missing values, assigning appropriate data types to columns, eliminating unnecessary columns, and combining the datasets using the VLOOKUP formula.

The next phase involved data cleaning and modeling. The main goal was to determine the content categories with the highest aggregate popularity. This required gathering the necessary requirements, cleaning the data, and performing appropriate modeling.

For data visualization and storytelling,Excel Pivot charts were utilized to create charts and visualizations that brought the data to life. Several insights were derived from the analysis:

Animals and science emerged as the two most positively reviewed and popular content categories, suggesting that users enjoy "real-life" and "scientific" content the most.

"Healthy Eating" was the top content category, indicating a strong interest in food-related topics. Additionally, the audio type of content received the highest acceptance.

The overall sentiments of users toward posted content were analyzed, providing valuable information on user engagement and preferences.

The amount of content posted over time was examined, showcasing the growth and activity trends on the platform.

The final step involved presenting the findings and recommendations to the client. A comprehensive presentation was created to summarize the entire project, including the data understanding, cleaning, modeling, analysis, insights, and visualizations.

Based on the analysis, it was recommended that Social Buzz consider leveraging the popularity of "Healthy Eating" to collaborate with healthy eating brands and boost user engagement. Additionally, with the positive sentiments observed in the animals and science categories, the company could explore creating campaigns and partnerships in these areas.

Overall, the internship experience with Accenture and Social Buzz provided valuable insights into real-world data analysis and consulting processes. Finally I presented the insights to stakeholders and clients.
